# normalize.less v1.0

Normalize.less is a customisable CSS LESS project based upon necolas/normalize.css that makes browsers render all
elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.

The project relies on researching the differences between default browser
styles in order to precisely target only the styles that need or benefit from
normalizing.

To facilitate further documentation and distribution of knowledge, normalize.css has been broken into separate chunks using LESS.
By breaking up each general category or rule, individual rules can be evolved, added, and reordered.

General Assertions:
a) You can't fix everything on all browsers.
b) You can make them behave more similar up to a point.
c) The point where you can't make them act the same, might be the point where you remove rules instead of add.

## Install

* [Bower](http://bower.io/): `bower install --save normalize.css`


No other styles should come before Normalize.css.

It is recommended that you include the `normalize.css` file as untouched
library code.

## What does it do?

* Preserves useful defaults, unlike many CSS resets.
* Normalizes styles for a wide range of elements.
* Corrects bugs and common browser inconsistencies.
* Improves usability with subtle improvements.
* Aligns form elements similarly across all browsers.
* Explains what code does using detailed comments.

## Browser support

* Google Chrome (latest)
* Mozilla Firefox (latest)
* Mozilla Firefox 4
* Opera (latest)
* Apple Safari 6+
* Internet Explorer 8+
